Instead, I found a deeply thought-provoking framework for engaging with AI more intentionally.<br/><br/>David Wood doesn’t just explain how AI works; rather, he helps you rethink how you think.<br/><br/>The paradigm-shifting mindset that “AI Is Not Google” (Chapter 3) is especially timely. It’s easy to just treat AI like an answer vending machine, when it carries the potential to empower “beginners to do the impossible” (Chapter 5).<br/><br/>So I’m recommending this book to anyone and everyone.

The authors make a compelling case that our sedentary culture is slowly eroding our health—even for those of us who exercise regularly. As they put it:<br/><br/>“Props to you for working out, but it’s not the same as moving your body throughout the day in all the healthy ways it’s hardwired to move.”<br/><br/>That hit home for me. I’ve fallen into the trap of thinking a solid run in the morning makes up for long hours sitting at a desk. This book challenged that mindset in a way that felt both empowering and actionable.<br/><br/>I also appreciated their nuanced view of fitness:<br/><br/>“If you want to see how good your fitness regimen is... see if you can move capably across platforms.”<br/><br/>In other words, functional fitness isn’t about crushing your favorite routine—it’s about being able to move well in any environment.<br/><br/>I thought I was fit because I run marathons, but the Ten Vital Signs opened my eyes to some glaring deficiencies in range of motion and functional strength. Since reading this book, I’ve started walking more throughout the day, adding weightlifting to my routine, and carving out time for regular mobility work. I'm grateful this book came into my orbit and I'm sure I'll refer to it many more times.",,,1,0

And it was diabolical. I fundamentally disagree with its Machiavellian premise that life is merely a quest for power and that deceit, cruelty, and manipulation are essential tools for success. <br/><br/>Admittedly, it was eye-opening and intriguing to consider how power-obsessed leaders in history (or in current times) may perceive the world. But my main problem with this book is that it is not written as an exploration on the concept of power, it is written as an often ruthless manual for obtaining power above all else which I find to be dangerous and misleading as a singular goal.<br/><br/>I also personally find unconvincing the argument that this book is still valuable for understanding how others might wield power against us. If I choose to believe that these laws truly do govern the world, then I have to sacrifice my trust in relationships, morality, and humanity. And that is too steep of a cost. ",,"It only took me a few pages into the preface to realize that I fundamentally disagree with the thesis of the book which made it difficult to read with an open mind. Admittedly, there might be truth in some of these ideas, but that makes the book feel even more dangerous if read as a manual for success (which is how it is written). Following these ""laws"" may result in obtaining more power but is that really worth the cost of sacrificing all morality, relationships, and humanity? Maximus > Commodus",1,0

He writes, ""Contrary to the naive view, information has no essential link to truth... Its defining feature is connection rather than representation."" Historically, information networks have often prioritized social order and power over truth.<br/><br/>Harari emphasizes that for networks to prioritize truth over falsehood, they must develop strong self-correcting mechanisms. He highlights how scientific institutions excel at this because they are not only willing to admit error and ignorance—they are actively incentivized to expose them. In contrast, the absence of such mechanisms in early modern Europe allowed the witch hunts to spiral into mass hysteria and false narratives.<br/><br/>At times, the book leans too heavily into a cynical, doomsday tone for my taste, but it did open my eyes to some potential scenarios I had never considered and caused me to temper my optimism somewhat around the advancements in AI.",,,1,0

While targeted towards rural communities, its lessons and stories resonate universally. As someone who doesn’t hunt, I still found the animal-centered stories and analogies captivating, offering a fresh and powerful perspective on mental health. Butterfield illustrates how we, as humans, are animals ourselves—and how self-destructive behaviors emerge when we fail to recognize and address our primitive (and often buried) emotions.<br/><br/>The book’s structure is a standout: each chapter explores a mental health topic with a creative title (such as ""Deer in the Headlights"" or ""Finding Your Herd""), ties it to an experience from the author’s life with animals, shares a real-life client story from his therapy sessions, and provides practical, science-based advice for the reader.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a quick and engaging read but packs a punch of insightful lessons.
