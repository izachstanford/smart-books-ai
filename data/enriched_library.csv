And it was diabolical. I fundamentally disagree with its Machiavellian premise that life is merely a quest for power and that deceit, cruelty, and manipulation are essential tools for success. <br/><br/>Admittedly, it was eye-opening and intriguing to consider how power-obsessed leaders in history (or in current times) may perceive the world. But my main problem with this book is that it is not written as an exploration on the concept of power, it is written as an often ruthless manual for obtaining power above all else which I find to be dangerous and misleading as a singular goal.<br/><br/>I also personally find unconvincing the argument that this book is still valuable for understanding how others might wield power against us. If I choose to believe that these laws truly do govern the world, then I have to sacrifice my trust in relationships, morality, and humanity. And that is too steep of a cost.

Now, in Edgedancer, the barely teenage nascent Knight Radiant finds that time stands still for no one. Although the young Azish emperor granted her safe haven from an executioner she knows only as Darkness, court life is suffocating the free-spirited Lift, who can't help heading to Yeddaw when she hears the relentless Darkness is there hunting people like her with budding powers. The downtrodden in Yeddaw have no champion, and Lift knows she must seize this awesome responsibility.

Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne.

Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled.

Creativity, Inc. is a book for managers who want to lead their employees to new heights, a manual for anyone who strives for originality, and the first-ever, all-access trip into the nerve center of Pixar Animation—into the meetings, postmortems, and “Braintrust” sessions where some of the most successful films in history are made. It is, at heart, a book about how to build a creative culture—but it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, “an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.” For nearly twenty years, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as the Toy Story trilogy, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, and WALL-E, which have gone on to set box-office records and garner thirty Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really is. Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admired—and so profitable.   As a young man, Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, where many computer science pioneers got their start, and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led, indirectly, to his founding Pixar with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter in 1986. Nine years later, Toy Story was released, changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movie’s success—and in the thirteen movies that followed—was the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar, based on philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention, such as:   • Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better. • If you don’t strive to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead.  • It’s not the manager’s job to prevent risks. It’s the manager’s job to make it safe for others to take them. • The cost of preventing errors is often far greater than the cost of fixing them.  • A company’s communication structure should not mirror its organizational structure. Everybody should be able to talk to anybody. • Do not assume that general agreement will lead to change—it takes substantial energy to move a group, even when all are on board.","['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Leadership', 'Management', 'Biography', 'Design', 'Audiobook', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Entrepreneurship']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400863577l/18077903.jpg,,"['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Leadership', 'Management', 'Biography', 'Design', 'Audiobook', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Entrepreneurship']"

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.Speak again the ancient oaths:Life before death.Strength before weakness.Journey before Destination.and return to men the Shards they once bore.The Knights Radiant must stand again.","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adult', 'Epic', 'Magic', 'Adventure']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388184640l/7235533.jpg,The Stormlight Archive #1,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adult', 'Epic', 'Magic', 'Adventure']"

Una buona pace, una pace in cui le comunità possano svilupparsi, può essere costruita solo quando chiediamo a noi stessi e agli altri di essere un po' più che buoni, un po' meglio che forti. E una buona vita, una vita in cui si può godere il mondo e vivere con uno scopo, la si può costruire solo se non ci limitiamo a vivere per noi stessi.» Il cuore e il pugno racconta il percorso di formazione di un uomo con un passato di combattente, Eric Greitens, oggi impegnato in politica come governatore del Missouri, che ha cercato di dare un senso alla propria esistenza a partire da questi princìpi.Una volta resosi conto che la comoda vita dello studente universitario gli andava stretta, Eric decide di girare il mondo in cerca di avventure, ma ben presto, dopo una deludente esperienza di insegnante in Cina, che nel 1993 presentava ancora tratti terribilmente simili a quella della strage di piazza Tienanmen, capisce che non è di questo che ha bisogno, ma di una strada da seguire. E così inizia a prestare servizio volontario in prima linea su diversi fronti umanitari: nei campi profughi in una Bosnia insanguinata dalle campagne di pulizia etnica, a fianco degli orfani dello spaventoso genocidio in Ruanda e dei bambini di strada in Bolivia, e infine in India a sostegno della missione di Madre Teresa.Ma più accumula esperienze, più si rende conto di una verità per lui incontrovertibile: di fronte a una minaccia concreta, l'uso della forza diventa una necessità. Decide allora di intraprendere la carriera militare sottoponendosi al terribile addestramento dei Navy SEAL, il corpo d'élite della Marina statunitense, che poi guiderà in molteplici missioni tra Afghanistan, Sudest asiatico, Kenya e Iraq, fra attacchi brutali e indicibili sofferenze, incontri strazianti, ma anche mirabili esempi di spirito di gruppo, solidarietà e fratellanza.È al termine e al prezzo di questo lungo e accidentato itinerario, dice Greitens, che il segreto di una «buona vita» gli si è rivelato nella sua paradossale semplicità, cioè quando ha finalmente capito che la compassione - il cuore - senza la forza vacilla, e che la forza - il pugno - senza la compassione è solo un colpo vibrato nel vuoto.","['Nonfiction', 'Military Fiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'War', 'History', 'Leadership', 'Biography Memoir', 'Military History', 'Politics']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348258902l/9525402.jpg,,"['Nonfiction', 'Military Fiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'War', 'History', 'Leadership', 'Biography Memoir', 'Military History', 'Politics']"

The subject was joy. Both winners of the Nobel Prize, both great spiritual masters and moral leaders of our time, they are also known for being among the most infectiously happy people on the planet.From the beginning the book was envisioned as a three-layer birthday cake: their own stories and teachings about joy, the most recent findings in the science of deep happiness, and the daily practices that anchor their own emotional and spiritual lives. Both the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Tutu have been tested by great personal and national adversity, and here they share their personal stories of struggle and renewal. Now that they are both in their eighties, they especially want to spread the core message that to have joy yourself, you must bring joy to others.Most of all, during that landmark week in Dharamsala, they demonstrated by their own exuberance, compassion, and humor how joy can be transformed from a fleeting emotion into an enduring way of life.","['Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Spirituality', 'Philosophy', 'Religion', 'Buddhism', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'Inspirational', 'Personal Development']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1458496394l/29496453.jpg,,"['Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Spirituality', 'Philosophy', 'Religion', 'Buddhism', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'Inspirational', 'Personal Development']"

Your fifth-grader sulks on the bench instead of playing on the field. Do children conspire to make their parents’ lives endlessly challenging? No—it’s just their developing brain calling the shots!In this pioneering, practical book, Daniel J. Siegel, neuropsychiatrist and author of the bestselling Mindsight, and parenting expert Tina Payne Bryson demystify the meltdowns and aggravation, explaining the new science of how a child’s brain is wired and how it matures. The “upstairs brain,” which makes decisions and balances emotions, is under construction until the mid-twenties. And especially in young children, the right brain and its emotions tend to rule over the logic of the left brain. No wonder kids can seem—and feel—so out of control. By applying these discoveries to everyday parenting, you can turn any outburst, argument, or fear into a chance to integrate your child’s brain and foster vital growth.

The effects were remarkable: Sasaki gained true freedom, new focus, and a real sense of gratitude for everything around him. In Goodbye, Things Sasaki modestly shares his personal minimalist experience, offering specific tips on the minimizing process and revealing how the new minimalist movement can not only transform your space but truly enrich your life. The benefits of a minimalist life can be realized by anyone, and Sasaki’s humble vision of true happiness will open your eyes to minimalism’s potential.","['Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Audiobook', 'Philosophy', 'Japan', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Japanese Literature', 'Memoir', 'Adult']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1478879474l/30231806._SY475_.jpg,,"['Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Audiobook', 'Philosophy', 'Japan', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Japanese Literature', 'Memoir', 'Adult']"

In his new book, Stillness Is the Key, Holiday draws on timeless Stoic and Buddhist philosophy to show why slowing down is the secret weapon for those charging ahead.All great leaders, thinkers, artists, athletes, and visionaries share one indelible quality. It enables them to conquer their tempers. To avoid distraction and discover great insights. To achieve happiness and do the right thing. Ryan Holiday calls it stillness--to be steady while the world spins around you.In this book, he outlines a path for achieving this ancient, but urgently necessary way of living. Drawing on a wide range of history's greatest thinkers, from Confucius to Seneca, Marcus Aurelius to Thich Nhat Hanh, John Stuart Mill to Nietzsche, he argues that stillness is not mere inactivity, but the doorway to self-mastery, discipline, and focus.Holiday also examines figures who exemplified the power of stillness: baseball player Sadaharu Oh, whose study of Zen made him the greatest home run hitter of all time; Winston Churchill, who in balancing his busy public life with time spent laying bricks and painting at his Chartwell estate managed to save the world from annihilation in the process; Fred Rogers, who taught generations of children to see what was invisible to the eye; Anne Frank, whose journaling and love of nature guided her through unimaginable adversity.More than ever, people are overwhelmed. They face obstacles and egos and competition. Stillness Is the Key offers a simple but inspiring antidote to the stress of 24/7 news and social media. The stillness that we all seek is the path to meaning, contentment, and excellence in a world that needs more of it than ever.","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Spirituality', 'Business', 'Audiobook', 'Productivity', 'Leadership']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1566883842l/43582733.jpg,,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Spirituality', 'Business', 'Audiobook', 'Productivity', 'Leadership']"
36072,The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change,Stephen R.

This book was wonderful education for people, education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a ‘success’ in life.But not everyone understands Stephen Covey’s model fully well, or maybe there are some people who haven’t read it yet. This is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us. Now, I am not saying that by using Covey’s model, or anyone else’s model for that matter, you can become a sure-shot success, but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold! So, where is the shortcoming?There are two main problems here, and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already. The first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of Stephen Covey in their lives. They consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee-table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it. They do not realize that this book contains life-changing information. Or, they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them.The second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of Covey’s ideals. These are people who are impressed by the book already. If you ask them what the seven habits are, they can rattle them off end to end, but then they miss the larger picture. They do not understand that Covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words. There are hidden implications in this book, yes, and a lot of people have just failed to see through them.That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to show you how Covey’s book, or rather, his model, was a complete model in itself. There was nothing amiss about it. If you implement it, there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched. The only thing is that you have to understand these ideals and try to implement them in your life.But, before we barge into that area, it is extremely important to understand what these ideals are. What was the model that was propounded by Stephen Covey in his mega-famous book? We shall begin by trying to understand his model first, and then interpret it in such a way that it pertains to every aspect of our life","['Self Help', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Leadership', 'Productivity', 'Management', 'Audiobook', 'Philosophy']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421842784l/36072.jpg,,"['Self Help', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Leadership', 'Productivity', 'Management', 'Audiobook', 'Philosophy']"

The book overall contains less detail concerning specific events than typical autobiographies. This is because his purpose in writing wasn't primarily historical. His aim was to identify & describe the events surrounding his accidental discovery of & consequent search for the phenomenon he labelled ""Joy"". This word was the best translation he could make of the German idea of Sehnsucht, longing. That isn't to say the book is devoid of information about his life. He recounts his early years with a measure of amusement sometimes mixed with pain. However, while he does describe his life, the principal theme of the book is Joy as he defined it. This Joy was a longing so intense for something so good & so high up it couldn't be explained with words. He's struck with ""stabs of joy"" throughout life. He finally finds what it's for at the end. He writes about his experiences at Malvern College in 1913, aged 15. Though he described the school as ""a very furnace of impure loves"" he defended the practice as being ""the only chink left thru which something spontaneous & uncalculating could creep in."" The book's last two chapters cover the end of his search as he moves from atheism to theism & then from theism to Christianity. He ultimately discovers the true nature & purpose of Joy & its place in his own life. The book isn't connected with his unexpected marriage in later life to Joy Gresham. The marriage occurred long after the period described, though not long after the book was published. His friends were quick to notice the coincidence, remarking he'd really been ""Surprised by Joy"". ""Surprised by Joy"" is also an allusion to Wordsworth's poem, ""Surprised by Joy-Impatient As The Wind"", relating an incident when Wordsworth forgot the death of his beloved daughter.","['Biography', 'Christian', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Memoir', 'Theology', 'Faith', 'Autobiography', 'Spirituality']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1381407473l/121732.jpg,,"['Biography', 'Christian', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Memoir', 'Theology', 'Faith', 'Autobiography', 'Spirituality']"

The sons of loggers, shipyard workers, and farmers, the boys defeated elite rivals first from eastern and British universities and finally the German crew rowing for Adolf Hitler in the Olympic games in Berlin, 1936.The emotional heart of the story lies with one rower, Joe Rantz, a teenager without family or prospects, who rows not for glory, but to regain his shattered self-regard and to find a place he can call home. The crew is assembled by an enigmatic coach and mentored by a visionary, eccentric British boat builder, but it is their trust in each other that makes them a victorious team. They remind the country of what can be done when everyone quite literally pulls together—a perfect melding of commitment, determination, and optimism.Drawing on the boys' own diaries and journals, their photos and memories of a once-in-a-lifetime shared dream, The Boys in the Boat is an irresistible story about beating the odds and finding hope in the most desperate of times—the improbable, intimate story of nine working-class boys from the American west who, in the depths of the Great Depression, showed the world what true grit really meant.

9484114,The Happiness Advantage: The Seven Principles of Positive Psychology That Fuel Success and Performance at Work,Shawn Achor,4,4.13,read,2020/02/18,2020/02/18,272.0,2010.0,2010.0,,9780307591562,"Our most commonly held formula for success is broken. Conventional wisdom holds that if we work hard we will be more successful, and if we are more successful, then we’ll be happy. If we can just find that great job, win that next promotion, lose those five pounds, happiness will follow. But recent discoveries in the field of positive psychology have shown that this formula is actually backward: Happiness fuels success, not the other way around. When we are positive, our brains become more engaged, creative, motivated, energetic, resilient, and productive at work. This isn’t just an empty mantra. This discovery has been repeatedly borne out by rigorous research in psychology and neuroscience, management studies, and the bottom lines of organizations around the globe.             In The Happiness Advantage, Shawn Achor, who spent over a decade living, researching, and lecturing at Harvard University, draws on his own research—including one of the largest studies of happiness and potential at Harvard and others at companies like UBS and KPMG—to fix this broken formula. Using stories and case studies from his work with thousands of Fortune 500 executives in 42 countries, Achor explains how we can reprogram our brains to become more positive in order to gain a competitive edge at work.             Isolating seven practical, actionable principles that have been tried and tested everywhere from classrooms to boardrooms, stretching from Argentina to Zimbabwe, he shows us how we can capitalize on the Happiness Advantage to improve our performance and maximize our potential. Among the principles he outlines:      • The Tetris Effect: how to retrain our brains to spot patterns of possibility, so we can see—and seize—opportunities wherever we look.    • The Zorro Circle: how to channel our efforts on small, manageable goals, to gain the leverage to gradually conquer bigger and bigger ones.    • Social Investment: how to reap the dividends of investing in one of the greatest predictors of success and happiness—our social support network  A must-read for everyone trying to excel in a world of increasing workloads, stress, and negativity, The Happiness Advantage isn’t only about how to become happier at work. It’s about how to reap the benefits of a happier and more positive mind-set to achieve the extraordinary in our work and in our lives.From the Hardcover edition.","['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Self Help', 'Business', 'Personal Development', 'Leadership', 'Audiobook', 'Health', 'Productivity', 'Science']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1381289860l/9484114.jpg,,"['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Self Help', 'Business', 'Personal Development', 'Leadership', 'Audiobook', 'Health', 'Productivity', 'Science']"

In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique. Zero to One presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places.","['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Economics', 'Self Help', 'Technology', 'Management', 'Leadership', 'Buisness', 'Finance']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1414347376l/18050143.jpg,,"['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Economics', 'Self Help', 'Technology', 'Management', 'Leadership', 'Buisness', 'Finance']"

How do we deal with the epidemic of fake news? Are nations and religions still relevant? What should we teach our children?Yuval Noah Harari's 21 Lessons for the 21st Century is a probing and visionary investigation into today's most urgent issues as we move into the uncharted territory of the future. As technology advances faster than our understanding of it, hacking becomes a tactic of war, and the world feels more polarized than ever, Harari addresses the challenge of navigating life in the face of constant and disorienting change and raises the important questions we need to ask ourselves in order to survive.In twenty-one accessible chapters that are both provocative and profound, Harari builds on the ideas explored in his previous books, untangling political, technological, social, and existential issues and offering advice on how to prepare for a very different future from the world we now live in: How can we retain freedom of choice when Big Data is watching us? What will the future workforce look like, and how should we ready ourselves for it? How should we deal with the threat of terrorism? Why is liberal democracy in crisis?Harari's unique ability to make sense of where we have come from and where we are going has captured the imaginations of millions of readers.

On Becoming Babywise brings hope to the tired and bewildered parents looking for an alternative to sleepless nights and fussy babies. The Babywise Parent Directed Feeding concept has enough structure to bring security and order to your baby's world, yet enough flexibility to give mom freedom to respond to any need at any time. It teaches parents how to lovingly guide their baby's day rather than be guided or enslaved to the infant's unknown needs. The information contained within On Becoming Babywise is loaded with success. Comprehensive breast-feeding follow-up surveys spanning three countries, of mothers using the PDF method verify that as a result of the PDF concepts, 88% breast-feed, compared to the national average of only 54% (from the National Center for Health Statistics). Of these breast-feeding mothers, 80% of them breast-feed exclusively without a formula complement. And while 70% of our mothers are still breast-feeding after six months, the national average encourage to follow demand feeding without any guidelines is only 20%. The mean average time of breast-feeding for PDF moms is 33 1/2 weeks, well above the national average. Over 50% of PDF mothers extend their breast-feeding toward and well into the first year. Added to these statistics is another critical factor. The average breast-fed PDF baby sleeps continuously through night seven to eight hours between weeks seven and nine. Healthy sleep in infants is analogous to healthy growth and development. Find out for yourself why a world of parents and pediatricians utilize the concepts found in On Becoming Babywise.","['Parenting', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Family', 'Childrens', 'Reference', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Health', 'How To']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442952647l/300650.jpg,,"['Parenting', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Family', 'Childrens', 'Reference', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Health', 'How To']"

Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her ""head-for-the-hills bag"". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found here","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Book Club', 'Adult', 'Education', 'Religion']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1506026635l/35133922.jpg,,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Book Club', 'Adult', 'Education', 'Religion']"

Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.(front flap)","['Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'Business', 'Science', 'Psychology', 'Sociology', 'Politics', 'Finance', 'Audiobook', 'Social Science']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1550917827l/1202._SX318_.jpg,Freakonomics,"['Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'Business', 'Science', 'Psychology', 'Sociology', 'Politics', 'Finance', 'Audiobook', 'Social Science']"

  A riveting historical narrative of the heart-stopping events surrounding the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and the first work of history from mega-bestselling author Bill O'Reilly
The anchor of The O'Reilly Factor recounts one of the most dramatic stories in American history—how one gunshot changed the country forever. In the spring of 1865, the bloody saga of America's Civil War finally comes to an end after a series of increasingly harrowing battles. President Abraham Lincoln's generous terms for Robert E. Lee's surrender are devised to fulfill Lincoln's dream of healing a divided nation, with the former Confederates allowed to reintegrate into American society. But one man and his band of murderous accomplices, perhaps reaching into the highest ranks of the U.S. government, are not appeased.In the midst of the patriotic celebrations in Washington D.C., John Wilkes Booth—charismatic ladies' man and impenitent racist—murders Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre. A furious manhunt ensues and Booth immediately becomes the country's most wanted fugitive. Lafayette C. Baker, a smart but shifty New York detective and former Union spy, unravels the string of clues leading to Booth, while federal forces track his accomplices. The thrilling chase ends in a fiery shootout and a series of court-ordered executions—including that of the first woman ever executed by the U.S. government, Mary Surratt. Featuring some of history's most remarkable figures, vivid detail, and page-turning action, Killing Lincoln is history that reads like a thriller. http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebre...~","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Historical', 'American History', 'Civil War', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Presidents', 'True Crime']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1317793681l/10587120.jpg,Bill O'Reilly's Killing Series,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Historical', 'American History', 'Civil War', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Presidents', 'True Crime']"

Selling the shoes from the trunk of his lime green Plymouth Valiant, Knight grossed $8,000 his first year. Today, Nike’s annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of startups, Nike is the ne plus ultra of all startups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the most ubiquitous and recognizable symbols in the world today.But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always remained a mystery. Now, for the first time, in a memoir that is candid, humble, gutsy, and wry, he tells his story, beginning with his crossroads moment. At 24, after backpacking around the world, he decided to take the unconventional path, to start his own business—a business that would be dynamic, different.Knight details the many risks and daunting setbacks that stood between him and his dream—along with his early triumphs. Above all, he recalls the formative relationships with his first partners and employees, a ragtag group of misfits and seekers who became a tight-knit band of brothers. Together, harnessing the transcendent power of a shared mission, and a deep belief in the spirit of sport, they built a brand that changed everything.","['Business', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Sports', 'Audiobook', 'Autobiography', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Biography Memoir', 'Leadership']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1457284880l/27220736.jpg,,"['Business', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Sports', 'Audiobook', 'Autobiography', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Biography Memoir', 'Leadership']"

With a passion that sometimes became obsessive, he pursued innovative studies of anatomy, fossils, birds, the heart, flying machines, botany, geology, and weaponry.

But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer.

How many will there be? And who will have them? We might imagine—and hope—that today's industrial revolution will unfold like the last: even as some jobs are eliminated, more will be created to deal with the new innovations of a new era. In Rise of the Robots, Silicon Valley entrepreneur Martin Ford argues that this is absolutely not the case. As technology continues to accelerate and machines begin taking care of themselves, fewer people will be necessary. Artificial intelligence is already well on its way to making “good jobs” obsolete: many paralegals, journalists, office workers, and even computer programmers are poised to be replaced by robots and smart software. As progress continues, blue and white collar jobs alike will evaporate, squeezing working- and middle-class families ever further. At the same time, households are under assault from exploding costs, especially from the two major industries—education and health care—that, so far, have not been transformed by information technology. The result could well be massive unemployment and inequality as well as the implosion of the consumer economy itself.In Rise of the Robots, Ford details what machine intelligence and robotics can accomplish, and implores employers, scholars, and policy makers alike to face the implications. The past solutions to technological disruption, especially more training and education, aren't going to work, and we must decide, now, whether the future will see broad-based prosperity or catastrophic levels of inequality and economic insecurity. Rise of the Robots is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand what accelerating technology means for their own economic prospects—not to mention those of their children—as well as for society as a whole.","['Nonfiction', 'Technology', 'Economics', 'Science', 'Business', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Politics', 'Futurism', 'Sociology', 'Society']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1411605128l/22928874.jpg,,"['Nonfiction', 'Technology', 'Economics', 'Science', 'Business', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Politics', 'Futurism', 'Sociology', 'Society']"

The legendary Omaha investor has never written a memoir, but now he has allowed one writer, Alice Schroeder, unprecedented access to explore directly with him and with those closest to him his work, opinions, struggles, triumphs, follies, and wisdom. The result is the personally revealing and complete biography of the man known everywhere as “The Oracle of Omaha.”Although the media track him constantly, Buffett himself has never told his full life story. His reality is private, especially by celebrity standards. Indeed, while the homespun persona that the public sees is true as far as it goes, it goes only so far. Warren Buffett is an array of paradoxes. He set out to prove that nice guys can finish first. Over the years he treated his investors as partners, acted as their steward, and championed honesty as an investor, CEO, board member, essayist, and speaker. At the same time he became the world’s richest man, all from the modest Omaha headquarters of his company Berkshire Hathaway. None of this fits the term “simple.”When Alice Schroeder met Warren Buffett she was an insurance industry analyst and a gifted writer known for her keen perception and business acumen. Her writings on finance impressed him, and as she came to know him she realized that while much had been written on the subject of his investing style, no one had moved beyond that to explore his larger philosophy, which is bound up in a complex personality and the details of his life. Out of this came his decision to cooperate with her on the book about himself that he would never write.Never before has Buffett spent countless hours responding to a writer’s questions, talking, giving complete access to his wife, children, friends, and business associates—opening his files, recalling his childhood. It was an act of courage, as The Snowball makes immensely clear. Being human, his own life, like most lives, has been a mix of strengths and frailties. Yet notable though his wealth may be, Buffett’s legacy will not be his ranking on the scorecard of wealth; it will be his principles and ideas that have enriched people’s lives. This book tells you why Warren Buffett is the most fascinating American success story of our time.","['Biography', 'Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Finance', 'Economics', 'Biography Memoir', 'History', 'Buisness', 'Autobiography', 'Money']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320458276l/2054761.jpg,,"['Biography', 'Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Finance', 'Economics', 'Biography Memoir', 'History', 'Buisness', 'Autobiography', 'Money']"

In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there's a better way.In Deep Work, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four ""rules,"" for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill.A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, Deep Work takes the reader on a journey through memorable stories-from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air-and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored. Deep Work is an indispensable guide to anyone seeking focused success in a distracted world.","['Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Business', 'Productivity', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Audiobook', 'Leadership', 'Management', 'Writing']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1447957962l/25744928._SY475_.jpg,,"['Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Business', 'Productivity', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Audiobook', 'Leadership', 'Management', 'Writing']"

Conventional wisdom long held that big name, highly athletic hitters and young pitchers with rocket arms were the ticket to success. But Beane and his staff, buoyed by massive amounts of carefully interpreted statistical data, believed that wins could be had by more affordable methods such as hitters with high on-base percentage and pitchers who get lots of ground outs. Given this information and a tight budget, Beane defied tradition and his own scouting department to build winning teams of young affordable players and inexpensive castoff veterans.  Lewis was in the room with the A's top management as they spent the summer of 2002 adding and subtracting players and he provides outstanding play-by-play. In the June player draft, Beane acquired nearly every prospect he coveted (few of whom were coveted by other teams) and at the July trading deadline he engaged in a tense battle of nerves to acquire a lefty reliever. Besides being one of the most insider accounts ever written about baseball, Moneyball is populated with fascinating characters. We meet Jeremy Brown, an overweight college catcher who most teams project to be a 15th round draft pick (Beane takes him in the first). Sidearm pitcher Chad Bradford is plucked from the White Sox triple-A club to be a key set-up man and catcher Scott Hatteberg is rebuilt as a first baseman. But the most interesting character is Beane himself. A speedy athletic can't-miss prospect who somehow missed, Beane reinvents himself as a front-office guru, relying on players completely unlike, say, Billy Beane. Lewis, one of the top nonfiction writers of his era (Liar's Poker, The New New Thing), offers highly accessible explanations of baseball stats and his roadmap of Beane's economic approach makes Moneyball an appealing reading experience for business people and sports fans alike. --John Moe","['Nonfiction', 'Sports', 'Baseball', 'Business', 'Economics', 'Biography', 'History', 'Audiobook', 'Finance', 'Science']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388176510l/1301.jpg,,"['Nonfiction', 'Sports', 'Baseball', 'Business', 'Economics', 'Biography', 'History', 'Audiobook', 'Finance', 'Science']"

Python is considered easy to learn, but there's no quicker way to mastery of the language than learning from an expert teacher. This edition of ""Learning Python"" puts you in the hands of two expert teachers, Mark Lutz and David Ascher, whose friendly, well-structured prose has guided many a programmer to proficiency with the language. ""Learning Python,"" Second Edition, offers programmers a comprehensive learning tool for Python and object-oriented programming.

Beyond language features, this edition of ""Learning Python"" also includes new context for less-experienced programmers, including fresh overviews of object-oriented programming and dynamic typing, new discussions of program launch and configuration options, new coverage of documentation sources, and more. There are also new use cases throughout to make the application of language features more concrete. The first part of ""Learning Python"" gives programmers all the information they'll need to understand and construct programs in the Python language, including types, operators, statements, classes, functions, modules and exceptions. The authors then present more advanced material, showing how Python performs common tasks by offering real applications and the libraries available for those applications.

In fact, the most common enemy lies within: our ego. Early in our careers, it impedes learning and the cultivation of talent. With success, it can blind us to our faults and sow future problems. In failure, it magnifies each blow and makes recovery more difficult. At every stage, ego holds us back.The Ego is the Enemy draws on a vast array of stories and examples, from literature to philosophy to history. We meet fascinating figures like Howard Hughes, Katharine Graham, Bill Belichick, and Eleanor Roosevelt, all of whom reached the highest levels of power and success by conquering their own egos. Their strategies and tactics can be ours as well.But why should we bother fighting ego in an era that glorifies social media, reality TV, and other forms of shameless self-promotion?  Armed with the lessons in this book, as Holiday writes, “you will be less invested in the story you tell about your own specialness, and as a result, you will be liberated to accomplish the world-changing work you’ve set out to achieve.”","['Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Self Help', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Business', 'Leadership', 'Audiobook', 'History', 'Productivity']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1459114043l/27036528.jpg,,"['Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Self Help', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Business', 'Leadership', 'Audiobook', 'History', 'Productivity']"

To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds.

Our choices and how we handle them shape the people we become.”In the aftermath of her 2008 presidential run, she expected to return to representing New York in the United States Senate. To her surprise, her former rival for the Democratic Party nomination, newly elected President Barack Obama, asked her to serve in his administration as Secretary of State. This memoir is the story of the four extraordinary and historic years that followed, and the hard choices that she and her colleagues confronted.Secretary Clinton and President Obama had to decide how to repair fractured alliances, wind down two wars, and address a global financial crisis. They faced a rising competitor in China, growing threats from Iran and North Korea, and revolutions across the Middle East. Along the way, they grappled with some of the toughest dilemmas of US foreign policy, especially the decision to send Americans into harm’s way, from Afghanistan to Libya to the hunt for Osama bin Laden.By the end of her tenure, Secretary Clinton had visited 112 countries, traveled nearly one million miles, and gained a truly global perspective on many of the major trends reshaping the landscape of the twenty-first century, from economic inequality to climate change to revolutions in energy, communications, and health. Drawing on conversations with numerous leaders and experts, Secretary Clinton offers her views on what it will take for the United States to compete and thrive in an interdependent world.

An astute eyewitness to decades of social change, she distinguishes the trendlines from the headlines and describes the progress occurring throughout the world, day after day.Secretary Clinton’s descriptions of diplomatic conversations at the highest levels offer readers a master class in international relations, as does her analysis of how we can best use “smart power” to deliver security and prosperity in a rapidly changing world—one in which America remains the indispensable nation.","['Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'History', 'Audiobook', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Feminism', 'Womens']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1402198745l/17727276.jpg,,"['Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'History', 'Audiobook', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Feminism', 'Womens']"

Tackling universal themes such as the friendship of a shared vision, and giving voice to America’s lonely and dispossessed, Of Mice and Men has proved one of Steinbeck’s most popular works, achieving success as a novel, a Broadway play and three acclaimed films.","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'School', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Read For School', 'Novels', 'High School', 'American', 'Classic Literature']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1511302904l/890._SX318_.jpg,,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'School', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Read For School', 'Novels', 'High School', 'American', 'Classic Literature']"

It was not a question, but a statement, filled with wonder.It stunned Nathan.""You believe it all.

There was still the incredulousness, still the sense of hearing something that couldn't possibly be true. And yet he knew it was. He knew without the least shadow of doubt that everything Joseph was telling him was true. And so, finally, with a wonder of his own, he said, ""Yes, Joseph, I believe you.""Pillar of Light — the first volume in the series The Work and the Glory — begins the epic story of the Benjamin Steed family. In the 1820s they move from Vermont to Palmyra Township in upstate New York in search of better farmland. There they meet a young man named Joseph Smith and are thrown into the maelstrom of conflict and controversy that swirls around him. Did he really see the Father and the Son in a pillar of light? Has he truly been visited by angelic messengers? What is all this talk about gold plates and new scripture? In short, is he a prophet and seer or a monumental fraud? The answers each one gives to these questions — intensely personal, potentially divisive — will dramatically affect the lives of the Steeds forever after.Author Gerald N. Lund here masterfully weaves together historical reality and high-powered fiction. In his hands this combination seems to make the reader an eyewitness to the early scenes of the Restoration, thus deepening one's understanding and appreciation of those momentous events. The well-drawn plot and fictional characters present a moving, gripping story. Here are Benjamin and Mary Ann Steed, devoted to each other as man and wife, yet at odds over religion; Joshua, their volatile son, who rebels and heads for trouble; the sensitive Nathan, their second son, in whom Joseph Smith's message strikes a responsive chord; the beautiful Lydia McBride, who captures the hearts of both Joshua and Nathan.This book skillfully explores the inmost motivations of Joseph Smith and his early followers and the responses of typical contemporary families to the claims he made. These people come to life in this powerful historical novel, a story that captures both the heartache and the happiness that came in the wake of Joseph's experience with the pillar of light.","['Historical Fiction', 'Lds', 'Lds Fiction', 'Religion', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Church', 'Adult', 'Christian', 'Christian Fiction']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1416338631l/625554.jpg,The Work and the Glory #1,"['Historical Fiction', 'Lds', 'Lds Fiction', 'Religion', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Church', 'Adult', 'Christian', 'Christian Fiction']"

The book soared to the top of bestseller lists internationally, igniting global conversations about women and ambition. Sandberg packed theatres, dominated opinion pages, appeared on every major television show and on the cover of Time magazine, and sparked ferocious debate about women and leadership. Ask most women whether they have the right to equality at work and the answer will be a resounding yes, but ask the same women whether they'd feel confident asking for a raise, a promotion, or equal pay, and some reticence creeps in. The statistics, although an improvement on previous decades, are certainly not in women's favour – of 197 heads of state, only twenty-two are women. Women hold just 20 percent of seats in parliaments globally, and in the world of big business, a meagre eighteen of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women. In Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg – Facebook COO and one of Fortune magazine's Most Powerful Women in Business – draws on her own experience of working in some of the world's most successful businesses and looks at what women can do to help themselves, and make the small changes in their life that can effect change on a more universal scale.","['Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Feminism', 'Self Help', 'Leadership', 'Womens', 'Audiobook', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Personal Development']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1364250803l/16071764.jpg,,"['Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Feminism', 'Self Help', 'Leadership', 'Womens', 'Audiobook', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Personal Development']"

Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years--as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues--Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson's portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. Steve Jobs is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.","['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Technology', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Leadership', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1511288482l/11084145._SY475_.jpg,,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Technology', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Leadership', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography']"

We are led to believe that if we could only look perfect and lead perfect lives, we'd no longer feel inadequate.

Then one morning, she woke up in a state of absolute joy, filled with the realization of how her own suffering had ended. The freedom of that realization has never left her, and now in Loving What Is you can discover the same freedom through The Work. The Work is simply four questions that, when applied to a specific problem, enable you to see what is troubling you in an entirely different light. As Katie says, “It’s not the problem that causes our suffering; it’s our thinking about the problem.” Contrary to popular belief, trying to let go of a painful thought never works; instead, once we have done The Work, the thought lets go of us.

System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble.

Over the past two years, she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed.Marketers at Procter & Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern—and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees—how they approach worker safety—and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives. They succeeded by transforming habits.In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. Habits aren’t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.","['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Self Help', 'Business', 'Personal Development', 'Productivity', 'Science', 'Audiobook', 'Leadership', 'Sociology']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1545854312l/12609433._SY475_.jpg,,"['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Self Help', 'Business', 'Personal Development', 'Productivity', 'Science', 'Audiobook', 'Leadership', 'Sociology']"

Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments?The shocking answer is: None of the above!In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states: ""Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!"" Eker does this by identifying your ""money and success blueprint."" We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money—and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success.Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and ""revise"" it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it.In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen ""Wealth Files,"" which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth.If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book.

Climb the ladder to personal success? The secret, master networker Keith Ferrazzi claims, is in reaching out to other people. As Ferrazzi discovered early in life, what distinguishes highly successful people from everyone else is the way they use the power of relationships--so that everyone wins. In ""Never Eat Alone,"" Ferrazzi lays out the specific steps--and inner mindset--he uses to reach out to connect with the thousands of colleagues, friends, and associates on his Rolodex, people he has helped and who have helped him. The son of a small-town steelworker and a cleaning lady, Ferrazzi first used his remarkable ability to connect with others to pave the way to a scholarship at Yale, a Harvard MBA, and several top executive posts. Not yet out of his thirties, he developed a network of relationships that stretched from Washington's corridors of power to Hollywood's A-list, leading to him being named one of Crain's 40 Under 40 and selected as a Global Leader for Tomorrow by the Davos World Economic Forum. Ferrazzi's form of connecting to the world around him is based on generosity, helping friends connect with other friends. Ferrazzi distinguishes genuine relationship-building from the crude, desperate glad-handling usually associated with ""networking."" He then distills his system of reaching out to people into practical, proven principles. Among them: Don't keep score: It's never simply about getting what you want. It's about getting what you want and making sure that the people who are important to you get what they want, too. ""Ping"" constantly: The Ins and Outs of reaching out to those in your circle of contacts all the time--not just when you need something. Never eat alone: The dynamics of status are the same whether you're working at a corporation or attending a society event-- ""invisibility"" is a fate worse than failure. In the course of the book, Ferrazzi outlines the timeless strategies shared by the world's most connected individuals, from Katherine Graham to Bill Clinton, Vernon Jordan to the Dalai Lama. Chock full of specific advice on handling rejection, getting past gatekeepers, becoming a ""conference commando,"" and more, ""Never Eat Alone"" is destined to take its place alongside ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" as an inspirational classic.","['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Leadership', 'Psychology', 'Relationships', 'Communication', 'Buisness', 'Management']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320417949l/84699.jpg,,"['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Leadership', 'Psychology', 'Relationships', 'Communication', 'Buisness', 'Management']"

The findings will surprise many readers and, quite frankly, upset others.The ChallengeBuilt to Last, the defining management study of the nineties, showed how great companies triumph over time and how long-term sustained performance can be engineered into the DNA of an enterprise from the very beginning. But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? The StudyFor years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great?The StandardsUsing tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck. The ComparisonsThe research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? The FindingsThe findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include:Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness.The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence.A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology.The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap.","['Business', 'Leadership', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Buisness', 'Management', 'Personal Development', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Audiobook', 'Finance']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1546097703l/76865.jpg,,"['Business', 'Leadership', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Buisness', 'Management', 'Personal Development', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Audiobook', 'Finance']"

Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on Time's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Literature', 'School', 'Novels', 'Coming Of Age', 'American', 'High School', 'Read For School']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1398034300l/5107.jpg,,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Literature', 'School', 'Novels', 'Coming Of Age', 'American', 'High School', 'Read For School']"

Committed to sharing what the scientific community already knew about self-control, McGonigal created a course called ""The Science of Willpower"" for Stanford University's Continuing Studies Program. The course was an instant hit and spawned the hugely successful Psychology Today blog with the same name.Informed by the latest research and combining cutting-edge insights from psychology, economics, neuroscience, and medicine, McGonigal's book explains exactly what willpower is, how it works, and why it matters. Readers will learn:Willpower is a mind-body response, not a virtue. It is a biological function that can be improved through mindfulness, exercise, nutrition, and sleep. People who have better control of their attention, emotions, and actions are healthier, happier, have more satisfying relationships, and make more money. Willpower is not an unlimited resource. Too much self-control can actually be bad for your health. Temptation and stress hijack the brain's systems of self-control, and that the brain can be trained for greater willpower.In the groundbreaking tradition of Getting Things Done, The Willpower Instinct combines life-changing prescriptive advice and complementary exercises to help readers with goals ranging from a healthier life to more patient parenting, from greater productivity at work to finally finishing the basement.","['Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Science', 'Productivity', 'Audiobook', 'Business', 'Health', 'Neuroscience']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1436737104l/10865206._SY475_.jpg,,"['Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Science', 'Productivity', 'Audiobook', 'Business', 'Health', 'Neuroscience']"

Not only is the cliché flawed-preexisting passions are rare and have little to do with how most people end up loving their work-but it can also be dangerous, leading to anxiety and chronic job hopping.After making his case against passion, Newport sets out on a quest to discover the reality of how people end up loving what they do. Spending time with organic farmers, venture capitalists, screenwriters, freelance computer programmers, and others who admitted to deriving great satisfaction from their work, Newport uncovers the strategies they used and the pitfalls they avoided in developing their compelling careers.Matching your job to a preexisting passion does not matter, he reveals. Passion comes after you put in the hard work to become excellent at something valuable, not before. In other words, what you do for a living is much less important than how you do it.With a title taken from the comedian Steve Martin, who once said his advice for aspiring entertainers was to ""be so good they can't ignore you,"" Cal Newport's clearly written manifesto is mandatory reading for anyone fretting about what to do with their life, or frustrated by their current job situation and eager to find a fresh new way to take control of their livelihood. He provides an evidence-based blueprint for creating work you love.So Good They Can't Ignore You will change the way we think about our careers, happiness, and the crafting of a remarkable life.","['Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Productivity', 'Psychology', 'Audiobook', 'Philosophy', 'Leadership', 'Education']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1360564614l/13525945.jpg,,"['Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Productivity', 'Psychology', 'Audiobook', 'Philosophy', 'Leadership', 'Education']"

Will the company fail? Lencioni's utterly gripping tale serves as a timeless reminder that leadership requires as much courage as it does insight. Throughout the story, Lencioni reveals the five dysfunctions which go to the very heart of why teams even the best ones-often struggle.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.” —Theodore RooseveltEvery day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable, or to dare greatly. Whether the arena is a new relationship, an important meeting, our creative process, or a difficult family conversation, we must find the courage to walk into vulnerability and engage with our whole hearts.In Daring Greatly, Dr. Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability. Based on twelve years of research, she argues that vulnerability is not weakness, but rather our clearest path to courage, engagement, and meaningful connection. The book that Dr. Brown’s many fans have been waiting for, Daring Greatly will spark a new spirit of truth—and trust—in our organizations, families, schools, and communities.","['Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Audiobook', 'Leadership', 'Parenting', 'Business', 'Spirituality', 'Relationships']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1337110319l/13588356.jpg,,"['Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Audiobook', 'Leadership', 'Parenting', 'Business', 'Spirituality', 'Relationships']"

Dr. Eben Alexander was one of those scientists. A highly trained neurosurgeon, Alexander knew that NDEs feel real, but are simply fantasies produced by brains under extreme stress.Then, Dr. Alexander’s own brain was attacked by a rare illness. The part of the brain that controls thought and emotion—and in essence makes us human—shut down completely. For seven days he lay in a coma. Then, as his doctors considered stopping treatment, Alexander’s eyes popped open. He had come back.Alexander’s recovery is a medical miracle. But the real miracle of his story lies elsewhere. While his body lay in coma, Alexander journeyed beyond this world and encountered an angelic being who guided him into the deepest realms of super-physical existence. There he met, and spoke with, the Divine source of the universe itself.Alexander’s story is not a fantasy. Before he underwent his journey, he could not reconcile his knowledge of neuroscience with any belief in heaven, God, or the soul. Today Alexander is a doctor who believes that true health can be achieved only when we realize that God and the soul are real and that death is not the end of personal existence but only a transition.This story would be remarkable no matter who it happened to.

They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society. In Quiet, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts—from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions.

It is the story of Americans in the ranks, men of every shape, size, and color, farmers, schoolteachers, shoemakers, no-accounts, and mere boys turned soldiers. And it is the story of the King's men, the British commander, William Howe, an his highly disciplined redcoats who looked on their rebel foes with contempt and fought with a valor too little known.At the center of the drama, with Washington, are two young American patriots, who, at first, knew no more of war than what they had read in books - Nathaniel Green, a Quaker who was made a general at thirty-three, and Henry Knox, a twenty-five-year-old bookseller who had the preposterous idea of hauling the guns of Fort Ticonderoga overland to Boston in the dead of Winter.But it is the American commander-in-chief who stands foremost - Washington, who had never before led an army in battle.

The authors make a compelling case that our sedentary culture is slowly eroding our health—even for those of us who exercise regularly. As they put it:<br/><br/>“Props to you for working out, but it’s not the same as moving your body throughout the day in all the healthy ways it’s hardwired to move.”<br/><br/>That hit home for me. I’ve fallen into the trap of thinking a solid run in the morning makes up for long hours sitting at a desk. This book challenged that mindset in a way that felt both empowering and actionable.<br/><br/>I also appreciated their nuanced view of fitness:<br/><br/>“If you want to see how good your fitness regimen is... see if you can move capably across platforms.”<br/><br/>In other words, functional fitness isn’t about crushing your favorite routine—it’s about being able to move well in any environment.<br/><br/>I thought I was fit because I run marathons, but the Ten Vital Signs opened my eyes to some glaring deficiencies in range of motion and functional strength. Since reading this book, I’ve started walking more throughout the day, adding weightlifting to my routine, and carving out time for regular mobility work. I'm grateful this book came into my orbit and I'm sure I'll refer to it many more times.",9780593534809,,,,,[]

He writes, ""Contrary to the naive view, information has no essential link to truth... Its defining feature is connection rather than representation."" Historically, information networks have often prioritized social order and power over truth.<br/><br/>Harari emphasizes that for networks to prioritize truth over falsehood, they must develop strong self-correcting mechanisms. He highlights how scientific institutions excel at this because they are not only willing to admit error and ignorance—they are actively incentivized to expose them. In contrast, the absence of such mechanisms in early modern Europe allowed the witch hunts to spiral into mass hysteria and false narratives.<br/><br/>At times, the book leans too heavily into a cynical, doomsday tone for my taste, but it did open my eyes to some potential scenarios I had never considered and caused me to temper my optimism somewhat around the advancements in AI.",9780593734223,,,,,[]

While targeted towards rural communities, its lessons and stories resonate universally. As someone who doesn’t hunt, I still found the animal-centered stories and analogies captivating, offering a fresh and powerful perspective on mental health. Butterfield illustrates how we, as humans, are animals ourselves—and how self-destructive behaviors emerge when we fail to recognize and address our primitive (and often buried) emotions.<br/><br/>The book’s structure is a standout: each chapter explores a mental health topic with a creative title (such as ""Deer in the Headlights"" or ""Finding Your Herd""), ties it to an experience from the author’s life with animals, shares a real-life client story from his therapy sessions, and provides practical, science-based advice for the reader.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a quick and engaging read but packs a punch of insightful lessons. Highly recommended.",9798991375825,,,,,[]

You can only move through it. There is a path through pain to wisdom, through suffering to strength, and through fear to courage if we have the virtue of resilience.In 2012, Eric Greitens unexpectedly heard from a former SEAL comrade, a brother-in-arms he hadn't seen in a decade. Zach Walker had been one of the toughest of the tough. But ever since he returned home from war to his young family in a small logging town, he d been struggling. Without a sense of purpose, plagued by PTSD, and masking his pain with heavy drinking, he needed help. Zach and Eric started writing and talking nearly every day, as Eric set down his thoughts on what it takes to build resilience in our lives.Eric's letters drawing on both his own experience and wisdom from ancient and modern thinkers are now gathered and edited into this timeless guidebook. Resilience explains how we can build purpose, confront pain, practice compassion, develop a vocation, find a mentor, create happiness, and much more. Eric s lessons are deep yet practical, and his advice leads to clear solutions.We all face pain, difficulty, and doubt. But we also have the tools to take control of our lives.

Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn't true?While tackling these questions, Malcolm Gladwell was not solely writing a book for the page. He was also producing for the ear. In the audiobook version of Talking to Strangers, you'll hear the voices of people he interviewed--scientists, criminologists, military psychologists. Court transcripts are brought to life with re-enactments. You actually hear the contentious arrest of Sandra Bland by the side of the road in Texas. As Gladwell revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, and the suicide of Sylvia Plath, you hear directly from many of the players in these real-life tragedies. There's even a theme song - Janelle Monae's ""Hell You Talmbout.""Something is very wrong, Gladwell argues, with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don't know. And because we don't know how to talk to strangers, we are inviting conflict and misunderstanding in ways that have a profound effect on our lives and our world.","['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Audiobook', 'Self Help', 'Sociology', 'Science', 'Business', 'Personal Development', 'Adult', 'Communication']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1549393502l/43848929._SX318_.jpg,,"['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Audiobook', 'Self Help', 'Sociology', 'Science', 'Business', 'Personal Development', 'Adult', 'Communication']"

Written more than two thousand years ago, the Tao Teh Ching, or -The Classic of the Way and Its Virtue, - is one of the true classics of the world of spiritual literature. Traditionally attributed to the legendary -Old Master, - Lao Tzu, the Tao Teh Ching teaches that the qualities of the enlightened sage or ideal ruler are identical with those of the perfected individual. Today, Lao Tzu's words are as useful in mastering the arts of leadership in business and politics as they are in developing a sense of balance and harmony in everyday life. To follow the Tao or Way of all things and realize their true nature is to embody humility, spontaneity, and generosity. John C. H. Wu has done a remarkable job of rendering this subtle text into English while retaining the freshness and depth of the original. A jurist and scholar, Dr. Wu was a recognized authority on Taoism and the translator of several Taoist and Zen texts and of Chinese poetry. This book is part of the Shambhala Pocket Library series. The Shambhala Pocket Library is a collection of short, portable teachings from notable figures across religious traditions and classic texts. The covers in this series are rendered by Colorado artist Robert Spellman. The books in this collection distill the wisdom and heart of the work Shambhala Publications has published over 50 years into a compact format that is collectible, reader-friendly, and applicable to everyday life.","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Classics', 'Spirituality', 'Poetry', 'China', 'Taoism', 'Self Help', 'Eastern Philosophy']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1333578861l/67896.jpg,,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Classics', 'Spirituality', 'Poetry', 'China', 'Taoism', 'Self Help', 'Eastern Philosophy']"

These behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial equilibrium and prevent any meaningful cross-racial dialogue. In this in-depth exploration, anti-racist educator Robin DiAngelo examines how white fragility develops, how it protects racial inequality, and what can be done to engage more constructively.","['Nonfiction', 'Race', 'Social Justice', 'Anti Racist', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Sociology', 'History', 'Psychology', 'Adult']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1575243997l/49045472._SY475_.jpg,,"['Nonfiction', 'Race', 'Social Justice', 'Anti Racist', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Sociology', 'History', 'Psychology', 'Adult']"

One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a naïve medical student ""possessed,"" as he wrote, ""by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life"" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. ""I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,"" he wrote. ""Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: 'I can't go on. I'll go on.'"" When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Medicine', 'Medical', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Philosophy', 'Science']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1492677644l/25899336.jpg,,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Medicine', 'Medical', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Philosophy', 'Science']"

Forty years later, Bridgewater has made more money for its clients than any other hedge fund in history and grown into the fifth most important private company in the United States, according to Fortune magazine. Dalio himself has been named to Time magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles that have led to Bridgewater’s exceptionally effective culture, which he describes as “an idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical transparency.” It is these principles, and not anything special about Dalio—who grew up an ordinary kid in a middle-class Long Island neighborhood—that he believes are the reason behind his success.In Principles, Dalio shares what he’s learned over the course of his remarkable career. He argues that life, management, economics, and investing can all be systemized into rules and understood like machines. The book’s hundreds of practical lessons, which are built around his cornerstones of “radical truth” and “radical transparency,” include Dalio laying out the most effective ways for individuals and organizations to make decisions, approach challenges, and build strong teams. He also describes the innovative tools the firm uses to bring an idea meritocracy to life, such as creating “baseball cards” for all employees that distill their strengths and weaknesses, and employing computerized decision-making systems to make believability-weighted decisions. While the book brims with novel ideas for organizations and institutions, Principles also offers a clear, straightforward approach to decision-making that Dalio believes anyone can apply, no matter what they’re seeking to achieve.Here is a rare opportunity to gain proven advice unlike anything you’ll find in the conventional business press.","['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Leadership', 'Finance', 'Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Biography', 'Management', 'Economics']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1503365703l/34536488._SX318_.jpg,,"['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Leadership', 'Finance', 'Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Biography', 'Management', 'Economics']"

Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? In Sapiens, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come? Bold, wide-ranging and provocative, Sapiens challenges everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our power ... and our future.","['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Science', 'Philosophy', 'Anthropology', 'Audiobook', 'Sociology', 'Historical', 'Psychology', 'Evolution']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1595674533l/23692271._SY475_.jpg,,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Science', 'Philosophy', 'Anthropology', 'Audiobook', 'Sociology', 'Historical', 'Psychology', 'Evolution']"

But through self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a U.S. Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him “The Fittest (Real) Man in America.”  In Can't Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40% of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential.","['Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Biography', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Audiobook', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Leadership', 'Military Fiction']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1536184191l/41721428._SY475_.jpg,,"['Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Biography', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Audiobook', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Leadership', 'Military Fiction']"

Around it, blue dolphins swim, otters play, and sea elephants and sea birds abound. Once, Indians also lived on the island. And when they left and sailed to the east, one young girl was left behind. — This is the story of Karana, the Indian girl who lived alone for years on the Island of the Blue Dolphins. Year after year, she watched one season pass into another and waited for a ship to take her away. But while she waited, she kept herself alive by building shelter, making weapons, finding food, and fighting her enemies, the wild dogs.

At age five-and-a-half she's knocking off double-digit multiplication problems and blitz-reading Dickens. Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world. For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Miss (""The"") Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge.She warms up with some practical jokes aimed at her hapless parents, but the true test comes when she rallies in defense of her teacher, the sweet Miss Honey, against the diabolical Trunchbull. There is never any doubt that Matilda will carry the day. Even so, this wonderful story is far from predictable. Roald Dahl, while keeping the plot moving imaginatively, also has an unerring ear for emotional truth. The reader cares about Matilda because in addition to all her other gifts, she has real feelings.","['Childrens', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Middle Grade', 'Humor', 'Audiobook', 'Magic', 'Juvenile']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388793265l/39988.jpg,,"['Childrens', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Middle Grade', 'Humor', 'Audiobook', 'Magic', 'Juvenile']"

Supernatural magic is what our ancestors used in order to explain the world before they developed the scientific method. The ancient Egyptians explained the night by suggesting the goddess Nut swallowed the sun. The Vikings believed a rainbow was the gods’ bridge to earth. The Japanese used to explain earthquakes by conjuring a gigantic catfish that carried the world on its back—earthquakes occurred each time it flipped its tail. These are magical, extraordinary tales. But there is another kind of magic, and it lies in the exhilaration of discovering the real answers to these questions. It is the magic of reality—science.Packed with clever thought experiments, dazzling illustrations and jaw-dropping facts, The Magic of Reality explains a stunningly wide range of natural phenomena. What is stuff made of? How old is the universe? Why do the continents look like disconnected pieces of a puzzle? What causes tsunamis? Why are there so many kinds of plants and animals? Who was the first man, or woman? This is a page-turning, graphic detective story that not only mines all the sciences for its clues but primes the reader to think like a scientist as well.Richard Dawkins, the world’s most famous evolutionary biologist and one of science education’s most passionate advocates, has spent his career elucidating the wonders of science for adult readers. But now, in a dramatic departure, he has teamed up with acclaimed artist Dave McKean and used his unrivaled explanatory powers to share the magic of science with readers of all ages. This is a treasure trove for anyone who has ever wondered how the world works. Dawkins and McKean have created an illustrated guide to the secrets of our world—and the universe beyond—that will entertain and inform for years to come.","['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Religion', 'Atheism', 'Biology', 'Evolution', 'Popular Science', 'Physics', 'Audiobook']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327883246l/11256979.jpg,,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Religion', 'Atheism', 'Biology', 'Evolution', 'Popular Science', 'Physics', 'Audiobook']"

At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate; this far from civilization the boys can do anything they want. Anything. They attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin and evil. And as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable novel about “the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart.”","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'School', 'Literature', 'Dystopia', 'Read For School', 'Novels', 'High School', 'Adventure']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327869409l/7624.jpg,,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'School', 'Literature', 'Dystopia', 'Read For School', 'Novels', 'High School', 'Adventure']"

They have transformed the way we see ourselves—and each other. They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives—and destroyed them.Published anonymously in 1776, six months before the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Paine’s Common Sense was a radical and impassioned call for America to free itself from British rule and set up an independent republican government. Savagely attacking hereditary kingship and aristocratic institutions, Paine urged a new beginning for his adopted country in which personal freedom and social equality would be upheld and economic and cultural progress encouraged.  His pamphlet was the first to speak directly to a mass audience—it went through fifty-six editions within a year of publication—and its assertive and often caustic style both embodied the democratic spirit he advocated, and converted thousands of citizens to the cause of American independence.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'American History', 'Historical', 'Essays', 'Political Science', 'American Revolution']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309209451l/161744.jpg,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'American History', 'Historical', 'Essays', 'Political Science', 'American Revolution']"

Christensen says outstanding companies can do everything right and still lose their market leadership -- or worse, disappear completely. And he not only proves what he says, he tells others how to avoid a similar fate.Focusing on ""disruptive technology"" -- the Honda Super Cub, Intel's 8088 processor, or the hydraulic excavator, for example -- Christensen shows why most companies miss ""the next great wave."" Whether in electronics or retailing, a successful company with established products will get pushed aside unless managers know when to abandon traditional business practices. Using the lessons of successes and failures from leading companies, ""The Innovator's Dilemma"" presents a set of rules for capitalizing on the phenomenon of disruptive innovation.","['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Management', 'Leadership', 'Technology', 'Buisness', 'Economics', 'Self Help', 'Finance']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347654027l/2615.jpg,,"['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Management', 'Leadership', 'Technology', 'Buisness', 'Economics', 'Self Help', 'Finance']"

Professors are asked to consider their demise and to ruminate on what matters most to them: What wisdom would we impart to the world if we knew it was our last chance? If we had to vanish tomorrow, what would we want as our legacy?When Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture, he didn't have to imagine it as his last, since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. But the lecture he gave, 'Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams', wasn't about dying. It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because time is all you have and you may find one day that you have less than you think). It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe. It was about living.In this book, Randy Pausch has combined the humour, inspiration, and intelligence that made his lecture such a phenomenon and given it an indelible form. It is a book that will be shared for generations to come.","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Inspirational', 'Self Help', 'Philosophy', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Adult']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1529682044l/40611510._SX318_.jpg,,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Inspirational', 'Self Help', 'Philosophy', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Adult']"
